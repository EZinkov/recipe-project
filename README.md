# Recipe Project

The Recipe Project is a web application built using React and styled with TailwindCSS. It utilizes data from the Tasty API to provide users with access to a vast collection of recipes.

With the Recipe Project, users can easily search for recipes based on a specific ingredient. Once a search is entered, the application will display a list of recipes that include that ingredient. Users can then select a recipe and view all of its details, including the ingredients, cooking instructions, and nutrition information.
